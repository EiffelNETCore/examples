# Machine Learning Examples: Eiffel Integration with .Net

This repository provides a collection of examples that demonstrate the integration of Eiffel with .Net for machine learning applications.

The `cs` folder includes helper libraries that facilitate access to C# generics features. At present, these features are not directly consumable from Eiffel. In addition to these libraries, the `cs` folder also contains relevant C# examples.

Eiffel examples, which demonstrate the usage of these libraries, can be found in the folders that are located at the same level as the `cs` folder.
